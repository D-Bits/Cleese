# Project-Initializers

Scripts to initialize different kinds of projects, with specific configurations. See in individual files for further documentation. Executables made with PyInstaller.

## File Guide 

* 'dotnetinit.py': For .NET Core projects.
* 'djangoinit.py': For Django projects.
* 'lampconfig.py': Installs Apache2, MySQL, and PHP on a Linux machine.
* 'phpinit.py': Scaffolds a PHP website.
* 'flaskinit.py': Scaffolds a Flask application.
* 'goinit.py': Scaffold a Golang project (work in progress).
* 'expressinit.py': Scaffold a Node/Express.js webiste (not yet working).
* 'gomvc.py': Scaffold a Golang MVC web project.

## Execution

Run the *scaffold_main.exe* (Windows), or *scaffold_main* (Ubuntu/Linux) file(s) from the *dist* directory in a local directory of your choosing. Sorry, I do not have a Mac, and therefore, no executable for MacOS. However, others are welcome to contribute an OSX executable, if they like. Until then, Mac users can CD into the repo, and run *main.py*.
